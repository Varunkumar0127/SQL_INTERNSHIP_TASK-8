📌 Project Title

SQL Task 8 – Stored Procedures & Functions in Hotel Booking System

🎯 Objective

To create reusable SQL logic for hotel operations using stored procedures and functions with parameters and conditional logic.

🛠 Tools & Technologies

MySQL 8.x

MySQL Workbench

SQL (CREATE PROCEDURE, CREATE FUNCTION, CALL)

📁 Deliverables

Stored Procedure: sp_create_booking → validates guest & room, checks availability, inserts a booking.

Stored Function: fn_booking_amount → calculates booking cost (room × nights).

Bonus Procedure: sp_guest_booking_count → demonstrates IN/OUT parameters.

📜 Task Activities

Defined procedures/functions with IN and OUT parameters.

Applied conditional logic (room availability, date validation).

Used SIGNAL for custom error messages.

Tested procedures/functions with sample booking data.

📌 Learning Outcomes

Learned difference between procedure vs function in MySQL.

Practiced conditional logic (IF, EXISTS) inside routines.

Understood how to modularize SQL logic for reuse in applications.

📝 Summary (2 lines)

Built stored procedures and functions to automate hotel booking operations.
Learned to use parameters, error handling, and conditional checks for real-world business logic.
